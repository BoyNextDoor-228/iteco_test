All features are in `src/lib`.
For now, the following feature is only 'product'.

Models are made using [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) package.

## Adding new feature or expanding the existing one

1) Go to the desired feature directory, there you will see three files:
    - feature_name.dart (code written manually),
    - feature_name.g.dart (generated code),
    - feature_name.freezed.dart (generated code).
2) Make changes you wanted to make,
3) Run build_runner script `dart run build_runner build` to generate new code files with applied changes,
4) Don't forget to make sure all tests of the feature you changed are passed.
